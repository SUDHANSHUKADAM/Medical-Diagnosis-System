# Medical-Diagnosis-System
# Abstract
The Medical Diagnosis System is a platform designed to assist patients in identifying potential diseases and recommending appropriate specialists based on collected symptoms. The system utilizes multiple trained machine learning models, each specific to a particular disease, to analyze patient inputs and provide accurate diagnoses. Integrated with a chatbot interface, the system enables seamless interaction with users, collects patient symptoms, and offers targeted recommendations for specialists in the Tempe and Phoenix areas. Phase 1 focuses on diagnosing diabetes, cancer, heart diseases, and COVID-19,laying the groundwork for future expansions into complex diseases and medical imaging analysis. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the system's design, implementation, and future directions.

# Introduction
The advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have revolutionized the field of healthcare by enabling data-driven diagnosis and personalized care. The Medical Diagnosis System leverages these technologies to provide a patient-friendly tool that enhances early diagnosis and facilitates access to healthcare specialists. Unlike traditional systems, this project employs separate ML models tailored to specific diseases, ensuring high accuracy in diagnosis. A chatbot serves as the primary user interface, guiding patients through symptom input and leveraging the trained models to identify potential conditions.
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To create a reliable system for early diagnosis of common diseases using machine learning models.
- To guide patients toward appropriate specialists based on the diagnosed condition.
- To maintain a secure and scalable database for storing patient history to enable personalized care.

In Phase 1, the system diagnoses fout critical diseases and recommends specialists located in the Tempe and Phoenix areas. Future developments will involve the addition of more diseases, integration of advanced diagnostic tools such as medical imaging analysis, and a broader geographic reach for specialist recommendations. This document outlines the project's methodologies, system design, and future goals.

Key datasets include:
- Diabetes Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Database - Includes blood sugar levels, BMI, age, and insulin data.
-	Heart Disease Dataset: Heart Disease UCI - Contains cholesterol levels, blood pressure, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina.
-	Cancer Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data - Features include tumor size, texture, smoothness, and concavity.
-	COVID-19 Dataset: COVID-19 Symptoms Dataset - Tracks symptoms like fever, cough, and oxygen saturation levels.
-	For Specialist a Demo dataset was created by Chatgpt

2. Database:- 
The database serves as a central repository for storing patient information, including:
-	User Profiles: Basic patient details such as name, age, and gender.
-	Symptom History: Symptoms provided during interactions with the chatbot.
-	Diagnosis Records: Results from the disease-specific models.
-	Specialist Recommendations: Locations and contact details of relevant specialists.
The database is implemented using PostgreSQL, ensuring scalability and security for managing sensitive patient data.

B) Algorithmic Implementation
1. Chatbot
The chatbot was developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and is responsible for:
-	Greeting the user and collecting basic information.
-	Guiding the user through a symptom-checking process.
-	Redirecting user inputs to the backend for analysis.

2. Disease-Specific Models
Each disease-specific model was trained using the following steps:
-	Pre-Processing: Cleaning and normalizing the data to remove outliers and handle missing values.
-	Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant features for accurate predictions.

Model Training:
-	Diabetes: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
-	Heart Disease: Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks.
-	Cancer: Decision Trees and Gradient Boosted Trees.
-	COVID-19: Na√Øve Bayes and XGBoost.

The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability. Libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch were utilized for implementation.
